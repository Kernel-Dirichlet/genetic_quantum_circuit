##########README FILE FOR QUANTUM GENETIC PROGRAMMING###############################


The purpose of this repo is to show that genetic/evolutionary algoriths have the power to remove the need for human engineers to hand craft 
quantum circuits. This repo features the evolution of basic quantum gates operating on single and multi-qubit systems. A Jupyter Notebook is
included to discuss the purposes of the project and the code in more detail. Contributors are more than welcome to submit upgrades and updates to this repo
through Pull Requests (PRs). Ideally, if users decide to fork the repository to apply the genetic programming code to classical circuits, or other
engineering/scientific problems, they will attribute credit to this repo. While I plan on maintaining this repo and updating it from time to time, I plan
on doing this project in Julia rather than Python, so the bulk of my focus will go there.
